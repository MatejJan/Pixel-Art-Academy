## Typography

The project is currently using these fonts:

- Retrotype by Matej Jan (www.retronator.com)
  Custom, proprietary font for Retronator

- Acme 9 Regular by Nikos Giannakopoulos (www.grixel.gr)
  Attribution-NoDerivs 2.5 license

- Uni 05 by Craig Kroeger (www.miniml.com)
  Available free under license at http://www.miniml.com/fonts/license/index.html (attribution)

Fonts are served in the WOFF cross-browser format as base64 encoded data URIs directly inside the CSS.

The CSS files are generated with Font Squirell (http://www.fontsquirrel.com)
